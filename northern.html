    <p>Oregon's north coast isn't known as a surfing destination. But laid-back towns and big breaks make up for the nip in the air. It stretches from the mouth of the Columbia River south to Florence, and here lies the state's biggest and most touristy beach towns. Despite the tourists flocking in from the city, the beaches are expansive and the surf is never too crowded. While the weather may linger around sub-par, bluebird days break up the monotomy of grey skies and when the wind takes a break, glassy lines form.</p>
